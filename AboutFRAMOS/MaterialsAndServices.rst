FRAMOS Sensor Module Ecosystem
===============================
The FSM Ecosystem consists of FRAMOS Sensor Modules, Adapters, Software and Sources, and provides one coherent solution supporting the whole process of integrating image sensors into embedded vision products. 

During the evaluation and proof-of-concept phase, off-the-shelf sensor modules with a versatile adapter framework allow the connection of latest image sensor technology to open processing platforms, like the NVIDIA Jetson Family and the NXP i.MX8 family. Reference drivers and sample applications deliver images immediately after installation, supporting V4L2 and an optional derivate API providing comfortable integration. Within the development phase, electrical design references and driver sources guide with a solid and proven baseline to quickly port into individual system designs and extend scope, while decreasing risk and efforts.

**Further to the off-the-shelf hard- and software, the Ecosystem supports you on project basis with:**

+ Driver sources allowing the focus on application specific scope and sensor features.
+ Electrical references for FSA and FPA, supporting quick and optimized embedding of FSMs.
+ Engineering services via FRAMOS and its partners, allowing you to focus on your product's unique value.
