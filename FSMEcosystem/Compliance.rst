RoHS
~~~~~~

The RoHS Directive (RoHS = Restriction of Hazardous Substances) complements the WEEE Directive by severely restricting the presence of specific toxic substances in electronic equipment at the design phase, thereby reducing the environmental impact of discarding such products at the end of their useful life. FRAMOS is committed to complying with this Directive and has worked in collaboration with its suppliers to evaluate the new restrictions, to identify relevant exemptions, and to substitute environmentally benign, compliant alternative materials in its product components and manufacturing processes. Subject to the available exemptions, FRAMOS products were compliant with the RoHS Directive for its products. 

Materials declarations comply with EN 63000:2018 requirements for RoHS Technical Documentation. EU Declaration of conformity according to RoHS are issued on customer demand.

REACH

- The requirements of REACH regulation of the European Council (EC) No. 1907/2006.
- The SVHC Candidate List.
- Our obligations concerning safety data sheets as well as informing customers.

WEEE
~~~~~~~~~~

The WEEE Directive obliges manufacturers, importers, and/or distributors of electronic equipment to label the equipment for recycling and to provide for recycling of the electronic equipment at the end of its useful life. FRAMOS is committed to complying with the WEEE Directive (as implemented in each EU member state). In accordance with the requirements of the WEEE Directive, FRAMOS has labelled its electronic products that are shipped. The WEEE label and instructions for disposal are as follows:

*Instructions for disposal of waste equipment by users in the European Union*

Electro Magnetic Compliance (EMC)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FRAMOS Sensor Module Ecosystem are OEM components/devices and provided at board level. Electrical components with no or open housings do not comply with standards for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), as the unshielded circuitry enables electromagnetic interference with other electronic devices. Users who integrate components of the FRAMOS Sensor Module Ecosystem into their systems are obliged to perform appropriate testing regarding electromagnetic interference and apply CE conformity.
