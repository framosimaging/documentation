Handling ESD Sensitive Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The electronic components like Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) described in this site are sensitive to Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) and need to be handled with great care in static controlled environments. It is strongly recommended to follow the general handling practices for ESD-sensitive parts, including but not limited to the following points:

- Treat all PCBs and components as ESD sensitive.
- Assume that you will damage the PCB or component if you are not ESD conscious.
- Handling areas must be equipped with a grounded table, floor mats, and wrist straps.
- A relative humidity level must be maintained between 20% and 80% non-condensing.
- PCBs should not be removed from their protective package except in a static controlled location.
- PCBs must be handled only after personnel have grounded themselves via wrist straps and mats.
- PCBs or components should never come in contact with clothing.
- Try to handle all PCBs only by their edges, preventing contact with any components.

FRAMOS is not responsible for any damages caused by ESD on the customer side.

Optical Sensor Modules and FSM:GO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To safeguard your optical sensor module performance and durability, exercise caution against abrupt changes in temperature or humidity. Condensation risks arise during such fluctuations and may impact the sensor module functionality. Adhering to this advice helps maintain optimal conditions, particularly when using lenses, ensuring a prolonged and reliable sensor module experience.

The FSM:GO optical sensor modules are precision-engineered products, requiring meticulous handling to maintain their high-quality performance. To ensure the integrity of these finely-tuned components, the following handling guidelines must be strictly adhered to:

- Always operate in an Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) safe environment. Personnel should be equipped with ESD-compliant clothing and, when feasible, wear protective gloves to minimize the risk of electrostatic damage to the module.
- Exercise extreme caution when handling the optical module. These are not merely inert objects but sophisticated optical instruments that demand careful and considered treatment.
- When picking up the module, do so by grasping the lens holder or the printed circuit board (PCB). Avoid contact with the lens itself to prevent damage.
- Refrain from exerting any rotational or undue force on the lens. Such actions can misalign the optical elements, compromising the module's performance.
- The front lens element should remain untouched. Contact with the lens surface can lead to contamination or scratches, which could significantly degrade image quality.

Cleaning the Lens Cover
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove dust from the lens cover, use a pressurized air duster. The air must be free of oil, moisture, or other contaminants that could remain on the lens cover. To clean the plastic window of the lens cover, use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol on a cleaning cloth. Do not scratch the plastic window. Do not pour the alcohol directly on the plastic window.

Cleaning the Module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To clean the outside of the reader housing, use a small amount of isopropyl alcohol on a cleaning cloth. Do not pour the cleaner directly onto the module.

*CAUTION:* Do not attempt to clean any products with harsh or corrosive solvents, including lye, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), or gasoline.

By following these handling instructions, you will preserve the functional integrity and optical clarity of your FSM:GO module, ensuring optimal performance in your vision applications.

Life Support Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These products are not designed for use in life support systems, appliances, or devices where malfunction of the products can reasonably be expected to result in personal injury. Customers, integrators, and end users using or selling these products for use in such applications do so at their own risk and agree to fully indemnify FRAMOS for any damages resulting from any improper use or sale.
