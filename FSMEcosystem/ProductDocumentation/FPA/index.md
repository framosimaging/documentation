# Processor Adapter (FPA)

FRAMOS Processor Adapters (FPAs) bridge the gap between cutting-edge image sensors and diverse processing platforms. By providing robust connectivity and signal management, our FPAs ensure optimal data transfer and sensor control. Each adapter in the FPA series is meticulously designed to support various interface standards, such as MIPI CSI-2, SLVS-EC, and Sub-LVDS/SLVS, catering to a wide range of application needs from industrial automation to advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

- Connects multiple FSAs to one processor board

- Processor board specific

- Differentiates two input interface types:

  - **A:** MIPI CSI-2

  - **BC:** Sub-LVDS / SLVS (**B**) and SLVS-EC (**C**)

## Key Features

- **Versatile Compatibility:** Supports multiple processor boards, including NXP i.MX, NVIDIA Jetson, 96Boards Consumer Edition, and AMD/Xilinx development boards.
- **Flexible Interfaces:** Accommodates different sensor interfaces like MIPI CSI-2, SLVS-EC, and Sub-LVDS/SLVS, ensuring broad application support.
- **Enhanced Signal Management:** Provides signal level translation, power conversion, and I2C access for additional sensor control.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** Features EEPROM for dynamic device tree management and configurable trigger routing for synchronization signals.
- **Robust Design:** Includes test points for critical sensor signals and offers technical drawings for precise hardware integration.
