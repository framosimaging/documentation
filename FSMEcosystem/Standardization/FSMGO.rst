Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FSM:GO series of optical sensor modules represents a specialized
subset within the FRAMOS Sensor Ecosystem, designed to accelerate the
deployment of vision systems with an emphasis on ease of use and rapid
integration. Built around cutting-edge image sensor technology, FSM:GO
modules are preconfigured with optimal lens pairings and precision focus
options to cater to specific application demands. The plug-and-play
nature of these modules, combined with FRAMOS's quality calibration,
ensures that they are not only ready for immediate deployment but also
finely tuned for exceptional performance in a wide array of vision
applications. The ensuing subsection provides an introduction to the
unique attributes and capabilities of the FSM:GO modules, guiding users
toward selecting the perfect vision solution.
