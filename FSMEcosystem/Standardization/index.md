# Overview

The FRAMOS Sensor Modules (FSM) encompass a broad range of
high-performance imaging solutions including the FSM+FSA and the for
volume optimized FSM:GO series. These modules are engineered to
facilitate seamless integration of advanced image sensors into a variety
of embedded vision systems. By offering standardized connectivity
features such as connector types, pinouts, mechanical formats, and
compatible accessories, the FSM Ecosystem delivers unparalleled
versatility and ease of use. Whether for initial evaluation,
proof-of-concept phases, or scaling up to mass production, FSM provides
a flexible and reliable foundation for your imaging requirements. This
section delves into the overarching characteristics of the FSM ecosystem
and explores the specifics of each module, complemented by detailed
datasheets for individual models.
